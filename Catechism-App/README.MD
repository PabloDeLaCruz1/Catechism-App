## Technology Stack:
SQLite

SwiftLint 

## Requirements /Backlog

List requirements. Break down big requirements into small parts that will allow us to write a user story for each requirement and add it to the Scrum Board under Backlog. 

A user story can be represented as a Trello(Scrum) card. Add start and end time + meeting notes here. You can write the whole story in the card title like this:

“As a: <role> I want to: <function-description> So I can: <value-statement>”

But this can look a bit crowded when you have many cards like these in a list. It's not optimal when trying to quickly scan a list of tasks. An alternative approach is to use a short form containing only the what in the card title: 

## Design

Schema Design - Outline the entities and their relationships:
Application View Flow Chart (StoryBoard):
Boilerplate/ Skeleton (github) 
Use Sketch to envision the final look of the product. (Optional)

## Development

Everyone starts by pulling main from github.
Pick a user story to implement.
When done, push changes to your own remote branch.
Someone else reviews and merges to main. 

## Quality assurance

Test main components 
(Optional/Hard) Implement Dependency Injection to make for more testable code
Apply SOLID Principles
