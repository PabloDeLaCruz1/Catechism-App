##Group Norms:
Everyone is equally responsible for this great project. Roles are for practicing real world scenarios. 
Strive to understand each other's perspectives, rather than jumping to conclusions
If you don't understand something, ask for clarification
If you see a problem that others haven't noticed, bring it to someone's attention
15 min Daily Scrum meeting to update User Stories


##Problem:

##Solution:

##Technology Stack:
SQLite
Swift
SwiftLint 


##Requirements /Backlog


List requirements. Break down big requirements into small parts that will allow us to write a user story for each requirement and add it to the Scrum Board under Backlog. 

A user story can be represented as a Trello(Scrum) card. Add start and end time + meeting notes here. You can write the whole story in the card title like this:

“As a: <role> I want to: <function-description> So I can: <value-statement>”

But this can look a bit crowded when you have many cards like these in a list. It's not optimal when trying to quickly scan a list of tasks. An alternative approach is to use a short form containing only the what in the card title: 


##Design

Schema Design - Outline the entities and their relationships:
Application View Flow Chart (StoryBoard):
Boilerplate/ Skeleton (github) 
Use Sketch to envision the final look of the product. (Optional)


##Development


Everyone starts by pulling main from github.
Pick a user story to implement.
When done, push changes to your own remote branch.
Someone else reviews and merges to main. 


##Quality assurance


Test main components 
(Optional/Hard) Implement Dependency Injection to make for more testable code
Apply SOLID Principles



##Presentation


Make Powerpoint slides 
Outline how we want the presentation to go.
Pablo starts the presentation
“Hello this is the Dream Team.”
“We have a problem with…”
“Our Solution to the problem is…”
“We used these technologies…”
“Since this is the first time some of us are using Agile/Scrum, we want to show our Agile/Scrum board and README.MD/White Paper to show our workflow.” 
“Now i'm going to pass it on to Teammate2, who going to go over… our features”
Teammate2 continues presentation
“Our application features are…”
“
“Now i'm going to hand it over to Teammate3 whos going to showcase our application Demo”
Teammate3 starts application demo and presents our features
“On our main screen you can…”
“Now i'm going to pass it over to Teammate4 whos going to finish showcasing 
opens the floor to questions: “Thank you for your time, do you have any questions?”
